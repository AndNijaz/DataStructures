DataStructures

This repository is intended for pushing all my data structures. I personally coded these data structures and tried to understand them in-depth. My goal is to, as a future professional programmer, know how and when to use each algorithm with the appropriate data structure to make my work as optimized and efficient as possible.

I chose Java for all data structures to avoid dealing with pointers and to stay at a higher level, preventing too much low-level involvement and potential memory leaks.

Also, here you can find all the algorithms I've written, and the same principles apply to them as for data structures.
